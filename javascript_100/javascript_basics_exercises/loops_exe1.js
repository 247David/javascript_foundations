//1. Loop and Log - Add some code inside of the for loop below that logs 
//the current value of i to the console on each iteration. 
//Before you run the code: What sequence of numbers do you expect to be logged?
// for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
//     console.log(i);
//   }

  //output:
  //0
  //2
  //4
  //6
  //8
  //10

  //2. Countdown - The code below logs the numbers from 1 to 10. 
  //Change it, so that it instead logs the numbers from 10 to 1 in decreasing order, 
  //and then logs 'Launch!'.

//   for (let i = 10; i >= 1; i -= 1){
//     console.log(i);
//   }


//3. Triple Greeting - Write a loop that logs greeting three times 

// let greeting = 'Aloha!';

// for (let i = 0; i < 3; i += 1) {
//     console.log(greeting);
// }

//4. Take Two - Write a for loop that iterates over all numbers from 1 to 100, and 
//outputs the result of multiplying each element by 2.

// for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i += 1) {
//     console.log(i * 2);
// }

//5. Looping over Array Elements - Using the code below as a starting point, write a while loop that 
//logs the elements of array at each index, and terminates after logging the last element of the array.

// let array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
// let index = 0;

// while(index < array.length) {
//   console.log(array[index]);
//   index += 1;
// }


//6. Continue - Take a moment to read the MDN documentation on the continue statement.
//Then write a for loop that loops over the elements of the array cities and logs the length of each string 
//to the console. If the element is null, skip forward to the next iteration without logging anything to the console.
